#### 3D model of the olfactory bulb (Migliore et al. 2014)

This repository contains the original NEURON code from the model:

Migliore M, Cavarretta F, Hines ML, Shepherd GM (2014) Distributed organization of a brain microcircuit analysed by three-dimensional modeling: the olfactory bulb [Front. Comput. Neurosci.](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2014.00050/abstract) 8:50, obtained from [ModelDB](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=151681).

There is an initial version of (elements of) this model in [NeuroML 2 format](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/MiglioreEtAl14_OlfactoryBulb3D/tree/master/NeuroML2).

The developing NeuroML 2 version of the model can be **viewed with the OSB 3D Explorer** as shown above. A [3 Mitral cell](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/miglioreetal14_olfactorybulb3d?explorer=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.github.com%2FOpenSourceBrain%2FMiglioreEtAl14_OlfactoryBulb3D%2Fmaster%2FNeuroML2%2FPartialBulb_3MTCells.net.nml) version of the network or a [30 Mitral cell](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/miglioreetal14_olfactorybulb3d?explorer=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.github.com%2FOpenSourceBrain%2FMiglioreEtAl14_OlfactoryBulb3D%2Fmaster%2FNeuroML2%2FPartialBulb_30MTCells.net.nml) version (slow to load!) are available.
